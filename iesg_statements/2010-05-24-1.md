IESG Statement on NomCom Eligibility and Day Passes
===================================================

24 May 2010

RFC 3777 requires that voting members of the nominating committee (NomCom) be selected from volunteers that have attended at least three of the last five IETF meetings.

The IAOC is conducting a day pass experiment, making it necessary to clarify the NomCom eligibility rules to address IETF participants that make use of a day pass. An update to RFC 3777 will be needed to address this situation if at the end of the experiment the IAOC decides to make day passes a regular meeting registration alternative. This statement provides guidance until an update to RFC 3777 is proposed, reviewed, and approved.

The eligibility requirements of volunteers for NomCom voting member positions are provided in RFC 3777, which includes:

14. Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 3 of the last 5 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.

In the context of the day pass experiment, this is interpreted to mean:

14. IETF participants must have attended at least 3 of the last 5 IETF meetings in order to volunteer. Use of a day pass for meetings prior to April 2010 counts as IETF meeting attendance; however, use of a day pass for meetings after April 2010 will not count as IETF meeting attendance.
