IESG Statement on Allocation of Email Addresses in the ietf.org Domain
======================================================================

21 Jul 2021

The IESG and LLC Board have formalized the following policy regarding the allocation of email addresses in the ietf.org domain:

* New email addresses for general and administrative roles under ietf.org must be chosen to avoid conflicts with potential IETF mailing list names
* The IESG must be consulted before any new email addresses under ietf.org are created and will have the sole responsibility for approving and managing addresses under ietf.org
* New individual email addresses for LLC personnel will be allocated under a new staff.ietf.org subdomain, with the LLC being solely responsible for the approval and management of those addresses
* Existing individual email addresses under ietf.org at the time the policy goes into effect will continue to receive email, which will be forwarded to new staff.ietf.org subdomain addresses; and outbound mail should be preferably be sent from staff.ietf.org addresses or role-based ietf.org addresses
