This is a dispute about a matter in a working group. The same matter has previously been raised with the working group chairs and responsible Area Director, as specified in RFC 2026 Section 6.5.1.


Writing acknowledgments sections is largely a matter of editorial discretion, where good sense and general attribution practices are the primary guidelines, although RFC 2026 Section 10.3.1 has some specific rules regarding acknowledgment of major contributors, copyright, and IPR.


After reviewing the appeal, including the associated list discussion and draft revisions, the IESG concludes that the authors made a reasonable editorial choice that was well within their discretion and that none of the messages at issue fall under the required acknowledgment rules of RFC 2026 Section 10.3.1 and RFC 5378 Sections 5.6a and 1c. The IESG finds that the chairs and responsible AD handled complaints about the matter appropriately.
