Hi John,  

(+ Allison and Adrian)  

Thanks for your email. While this document was on the Nov 30 telechat schedule for a month, the AD shepherd for the conflict review was not assigned until the week of the telechat, as has been typical practice on the IESG for many years. Given the timing of the shepherd assignment, the shepherd and the rest of the IESG did not have time to conduct the conflict review prior to this week’s telechat. While we wouldn’t expect it to be common for conflict reviews to require our attention on a particular telechat date, we would be happy for the ISE and IRTF Chair to provide us with advance warning (beyond the automated telechat update notice) when scheduling a conflict review they’d like to see prioritized.

We will plan to process conflict-review-klensin-dns-function-considerations-00.txt on 12/14 as currently scheduled.

Regards,  
Alissa on behalf of the IESG
