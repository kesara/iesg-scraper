 
IESG Response to Patrick Masotta on the Appeal re draft-masotta-tftpexts-windowsize-opt 


27 January 2014


Patrick Masotta has appealed the IESG's failure to publish the 
 document draft-masotta-tftpexts-windowsize-opt, through a combination 
 of a "Do Not Publish" recommendation to the Independent Stream Editor 
 during its RFC 5742 review of the draft, and not bringing the document to 
 Last Call during AD-sponsorship of the document. The full appeal is available here:


[https://www.ietf.org/iesg/appeal/masotta-2013-11-14.txt](masotta-2013-11-14.txt).


Background:


During the RFC 5742 review of draft-masotta-tftpexts-windowsize-opt, the IESG determined that the document extended an IETF protocol in a way that requires IETF review. Martin Stiemerling (TSV AD) volunteered to shepherd the document through the IETF process since the primary concern raised against the document was its lack of congestion control capabilities, and Mr Stiemerling and Mr Masotta began discussion on those issues. After a few exchanges, the discussion broke down and did not complete. The IESG believes Mr Masotta is appealing the "Do Not Publish" decision and the failure to bring the document to Last Call based on his belief that:  

  

 1) the Transport Area Directors had a conflict of interest due to  

 their private jobs 


2) a lapse in the ethics of the TSV ADs led to an inadequate review 
 of his draft. 


The IESG believes this appeal falls under section 6.5.2 of RFC 2026 
 since it relates to a process responsiblity of the IESG (RFC 5742 
 conflict review of Independent Stream documents). 


In evaluating this appeal, the IESG reviewed all e-mail exchanges 
 between Mr Masotta and the TSV & APPs ADs to determine if any 
 indication of an ethical lapse occurred during the RFC 5742 review 
 process. Additionally, the IESG reviewed the corporate website for 
 Wesley Eddy's employer since Mr Masotta claimed that Mr Eddy's 
 employer is selling his services as an IESG member 
 (<http://www.mti-systems.com/services.html>). 


Analysis: 


The IESG's evaluation did not find any conflict of interest related to 
 this document, nor any actions on the part of the TSV ADs that the 
 IESG could consider indicative of such a conflict. The IESG did not 
 find any indication that the "Do Not Publish" decision it made for 
 this document was unduly or improperly influenced by the TSV 
 ADs. Additionally, while the MTI Systems website does indicate a 
 willingness to participate in the development of protocols in 
 standards bodies (particularly noting the IETF), including taking on 
 leadership roles, it does not imply any type of preferential 
 treatment for customers looking to work within the IETF, and the 
 IESG therefore did not find this statement to be problematic. 


The IESG did not find any indication of unethical behavior by the 
 TSV ADs. There has been no indication that the involved ADs have 
 attempted to push forth a competing draft. In fact, Mr Stiemerling's 
 willingness to shepherd the draft through the IETF process indicates 
 an interest in helping Mr Masotta with the IETF publishing process. 
 The discussion appears to have broken down due to disagreement as to 
 the validity of the issues Mr Stiemerling raised, and the IESG does not 
 believe those issues have yet been adequately addressed in the discussion. 


Given the above, the IESG finds that the proper process was followed, 
 there was no indication of a conflict of interest, and that the TSV 
 ADs acted ethically. 


That said, the IESG notes that this appeal is not the only avenue 
 available to Mr Masotta: another AD, outside the TSV area, may be 
 willing to sponsor the draft, and the IESG encourages Mr Masotta to 
 make another attempt to resolve the open issues, move the document 
 through the IETF process, and get the document published.
